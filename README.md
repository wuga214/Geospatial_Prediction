# Geospatial_Prediction

Progress
===
1. Baseline algorithms are good to work now.<br />
2. Cross-validation is ok for single regression problem, the auto-table generater fucntion is under constuction.<br />
3. Gaussian processing for large data has risk to be stuck, it is better to test this algorithm under 1000 data point.In cross-validation, in default, there will 30% of total data point used to train model, therefore, the running time will be very long, please be aware of that.<br />
