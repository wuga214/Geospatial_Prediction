# Geospatial_Prediction

IDEA
===
1. Simple draw sample from Gibbs to do BMA may be not good choice because some of those samples has lower likelihood. I am considering to change the Gibbs Sampling into Simulated Annealing Algorithm, so that it always looking for the sample has largest likelihood.

TO RUN
===
src/evaluation/CrossValidations.java //This will run Kruskal MST merging to look for the best partitioning, limited by searching space.
src/samping/Gibbs.java //Gibbs samping merging, through entire hypothesis space.

Progress
===
1. Baseline algorithms are good to work now.<br />
2. Cross-validation is now full functional.<br />
3. Gaussian processing for large data has risk to be stuck, it is better to test this algorithm under 1000 data point.In cross-validation, in default, there will 30% of total data point used to train model, therefore, the running time will be very long, please be aware of that.<br />
4. Gibbs Samping now full functional<br />
